# TorchtoTRTProject
Project with GUI to convert Torch model to TensorRT models

Readme

Hello! Welcome to my project, for Prototyping Interact Sys - CS-6452-A! The way to run this project is on a system that has a NVIDIA GPU, or an account that has COLAB access.

Settings: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-22W2dk5EQs_fj5RKC9VBynY3DaNQ6hU?usp=sharing

STEPS:

Step 1: Import Dog_Breed_Classifications.ipynb and TorchtoTRT.ipynb to Google Colab

Step 2: Open Dog_Breed_Classifications.ipynb and Enable GPU runtime in Google Colab (Runtime -> Change Runtime -> GPU -> Save)

OPTIONAL (Run Dog_Breed_Classifications.ipynb)

Step 3: Models are presaved in the Inputs folder, add these folders to your Drive account (Add Shortcut to MyDrive)

Step 4: Run trtgui.py on local computer to get GUI and add settings

Step 5: Run all cells of TorchtoTRT.ipynb in Google Colab to see results at the end
